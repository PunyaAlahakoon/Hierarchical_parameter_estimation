# Hierarchical_para_estimation 
 Codes for the paper.
 
 This folder contains codes that can be used to estimate paranmeters of a stochastic hierachical model using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. 
 
 The model structure used in these codes is an SIRS stochastic epidemic model across 15 (sub)-populations.
